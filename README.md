# Point-Cloud-Density-Optimization
Point Cloud Density Optimization for Better Object Detection

An implementation of the paper "Improving LiDAR 3D Object Detection via Range-based Point Cloud
Density Optimization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05663). The Object Detection model improved using the implementation is PointPillars (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05784).

This code requires Open3D-ML: https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D-ML. Update kitti.py in /open3d/_ml3d/datasets/kitti.py.
